CLKC-26#1 Advisory
MMCME4 with BUF_IN drives sequential IO with CLKOUT0  
The MMCME4 cell hardware_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/mmcme4_adv_inst has COMPENSATION value BUF_IN, but CLKOUT0 output drives sequential cells directly connected to ports. In order to achieve insertion delay and phase-alignment for the sequential cells directly connected to ports, a COMPENSATION of ZHOLD must be used. (The problem cell is stop2_IBUF_inst/IBUFCTRL_INST (in stop2_IBUF_inst macro).)
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-30#1 Advisory
MMCME4 not driven by IO has BUFG in feedback loop  
The MMCME4 cell hardware_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/mmcme4_adv_inst has a BUFGCE hardware_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clkf_buf clock buffer in the feedback loop, but the clock input is not directly driven by an I/O to create a Zero Delay Buffer Clock (a common use for having a buffer in the feedback loop). If there is no specific need for this buffer in the feedback loop (e.g. no timing paths between CLKINx/CLKOUTx domains or low latency requirement), then it is suggested to remove that BUFG* from the feedback path. This will allow for a lower power solution and free the clock resource for other purposes.

MMCME4 with global clock driver has no LOC  
The MMCME4_ADV cell hardware_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/mmcme4_adv_inst CLKIN1 or CLKIN2 pin is driven by global Clock buffer(s) hardware_i/zynq_ultra_ps/inst/buffer_pl_clk_0.PL_CLK_0_BUFG and does not have a LOC constraint. It is recommended to LOC the MMCM and use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint on the net(s) driven by the global Clock buffer(s).
